# Design patterns

## What is
> A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. 
> 
> A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. 
> 
> It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in object-oriented design.

## Classification of Design Patterns

### 1. Creation-al Patterns
This design patterns is all about class instantiation.  
This pattern can be further divided into:
 - _class-creation_ patterns (use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process) 
 - _object-creational_ patterns (use delegation effectively to get the job done)

#### 1.1 Abstract Factory
#### 1.2 Builder
#### 1.3 Factory Method
#### 1.4 Object Pool
#### 1.5 Prototype
#### 1.6 Singleton

### 2. Structural Patterns
This design patterns is all about Class and Object composition:
- Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces
- Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

#### 2.1 Adapter
#### 2.2 Bridge
#### 2.3 Composite
#### 2.4 Decorator
#### 2.5 Facade
#### 2.6 Flyweight
#### 2.7 Private Class Data
#### 2.8 Proxy

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
This design patterns is all about Class's objects communication.

Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

#### 3.1 Chain of responsibility
#### 3.2 Command
#### 3.3 Interpreter
#### 3.4 Iterator
#### 3.5 Mediator
#### 3.6 Memento
#### 3.7 Null Object
#### 3.8 Observer
#### 3.9 State
#### 3.10 Strategy
#### 3.11 Template method 
#### 3.12 Visitor

### 4 Architectural Patterns
#### 4.1 Model-View-Controller
#### 4.2 Service-Oriented Architecture
#### 4.3 Micro-services
#### 4.4 Asynchronous Queuing
#### 4.5 Message Queue Pattern
